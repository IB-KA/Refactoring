# Refactoring

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/ad8c77b5a40d407baa14475de507b633)](https://app.codacy.com/app/IB-KA/Refactoring?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=IB-KA/Refactoring&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

I used IntelliJ to refactor this, using the inbuild refactoring options like moving methods or extracting them and also the auto code checks, that can be triggered when commiting via the IDE
